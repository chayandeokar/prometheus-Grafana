# prometheus-Grafana

This is a **Work-In-Progress** Repo for learning how monitor your kubernetes clusters using prometheus and visualize using grafana.

Both Prometheus and Grafana have a very good documentation 

[Prometheus Docs]("https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/")

[Grafana Docs]("https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/")

## Pre-Requisite

- Kubernetes Cluster (can be minikube)
- Helm 

If you don't have them installed. Follow the below links:

[Install Minikube]("https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/")

[Install Helm]("https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/")

## It all starts with Monitoring 

Monitoring your Kubernetes cluster is essential for ensuring the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure. Here are some reasons why monitoring your Kubernetes cluster is important:

- Identify issues and troubleshoot: By monitoring your Kubernetes cluster, you can quickly identify issues such as application crashes, resource bottlenecks, and network problems. With real-time monitoring, you can troubleshoot issues before they escalate and impact your users.

- Optimize performance and capacity: Monitoring allows you to track the performance of your applications and infrastructure over time, and identify opportunities to optimize performance and capacity. By understanding usage patterns and resource consumption, you can make informed decisions about scaling your infrastructure and improving the efficiency of your applications.

- Ensure high availability: Kubernetes is designed to provide high availability for your applications, but this requires careful monitoring and management. By monitoring your cluster and setting up alerts, you can ensure that your applications remain available even in the event of failures or unexpected events.

- Security and compliance: Monitoring your Kubernetes cluster can help you identify potential security risks and ensure compliance with regulations and policies. By tracking access logs and other security-related metrics, you can quickly detect and respond to potential security threats.
